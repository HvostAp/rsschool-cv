**Briefly About Myself:**

The story is this: for several years I have been freelancing on the Internet. Soon I realized that I needed to move on, and I decided to go to a more professional level to improve my knowledge and get a real job in IT. While going through several different courses on the Internet, I came across RS Shool, which was also recommended to me by my friend :). At the moment my goal is to learn *Frontend*.

**Code example:**

**The highest kata that I managed to solve all the time from CODWARS:** *It was necessary to write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all zeros to the end. The algorithm must preserve the order of the remaining elements.*

>***5 kyu***

```js 
function moveZeros(arr) {
    const zero = arr.filter(n => n === 0)
    arr = arr.filter(n => n !== 0)
    arr = [...arr, ...zero]
    return arr
}
```
```js
assert.deepEqual(moveZeros([1,2,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1]), [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
```
